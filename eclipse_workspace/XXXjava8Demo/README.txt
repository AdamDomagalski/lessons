This consist of files that I created in order to try some of the new java 8 features.

You will find usage of:

* Lambdas
* Functional interfaces ( and other interfaces modifications)
* Predicates
* new Date Time API
* Optional
* String Joiner
* Type annotations ( this demo is partialy working see my annotationDemo project for working example )
